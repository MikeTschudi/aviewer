# Accessibility Viewer (aViewer)

The Accessibility Viewer (aViewer) is an inspection tool for Windows that displays the accessibility API information (MSAA, IAccessible2, UI Automation, ARIA, HTML DOM) exposed by web browsers to the operating system, and thus to any assistive technology (AT) such as screenreaders.

For further information, see [The Paciello Group's aViewer resource page](http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/aviewer/).

For a basic manual/introduction to aViewer's functionality, see [The Paciello Group blog: aViewer](http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2013/03/aviewer-2013/).
